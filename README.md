# Arch Insights

This repository contains notes and insights from my experience using Arch Linux. I try to cover valuable information on how to fix errors, how to approach tasks like connecting to wifi or mounting drives, etc.

The notes are not organized in a strict order. However, file and directory names are clear and descriptive.

If you find incorrect or outdated information, feel free to open an issue.

For in-depth notes on other Linux concepts, see this repository: [linux_deep_dive](https://github.com/raymondmwaura-osdev/linux_deep_dive.git).
